# 🛑 Sleep Detector – Driver Drowsiness Prevention System

A hardware-based safety system designed to prevent driver drowsiness and reduce road accidents. This project utilizes Arduino Uno, Python, and OpenCV to detect signs of drowsiness in real time and trigger an alert mechanism.

**✨ Features:**

✅ Real-time Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV

✅ Buzzer Alert System to wake the driver

✅ Speed Reduction Mechanism for enhanced safety

✅ Arduino Uno Microcontroller for hardware integration

**🔧 Technologies Used:**

Arduino Uno for microcontroller operations

Python & OpenCV for real-time face detection

Buzzer & Actuators for alert and safety mechanisms

**📂 Repository Contents:**

arduino.ino – Contains Arduino code for hardware control

detection.py – Python script for real-time drowsiness detection

**🚀 How It Works:**

1️⃣ The system continuously monitors the driver's face using OpenCV.

2️⃣ If drowsiness is detected, an alert buzzer activates.

3️⃣ The system can also reduce vehicle speed to prevent accidents.

This project aims to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue. 🚗⚠️
